# Exercise: Play with SQL

Let's practice with SQL now
In groups of 2-3 trainees, your job is to:

* Setup the database
* Create the table and fill it with data
* Answer the questions using ONE query

When all groups have finished, let's compare the solutions.


## Exercise 1

Count the number of rows in the people table.

Hint: Use select

## Exercise 2

Find the IP address of the person with first name "Martie".

## Exercise 3

Return the full name of the first 10 people in one result column.

Hint: The full name column is NULL, so you need to work around this.

## Exercise 4

Return the first 10 people, ordered by last name and then first name, in a descending order.

Hint: Beware of case sensitivity!

## Exercise 5

Return the number of female people.

## Exercise 6

Return the number of people that are male, and the number of people that are female.

## Exercise 7

Return the number of people, grouped by gender, except where it's unknown.

## Exercise 8

Return the number of people, grouped by gender, but only when there are more than 100.

## Exercise 9

Add a new person to the table.

## Exercise 10

Set all full names to be equal to the last name and the first name, separated with a comma and a space.

## Exercise 11

Set the gender of person with SSN "605-20-8727" to be "Non-binary".
